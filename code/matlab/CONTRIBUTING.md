# Contributing to the Matlab L3Pilot Templates

If you have never worked with git before, one of the many introductions to git that can be found online might be helpful.
For specific functions regarding the Gitlab functionalities, the [Help](https://gitlab.ika.rwth-aachen.de/help) pages are resourceful.

## Development

By default, the `master` branch is protected and cannot be directly pushed to.
The general workflow for contributing is as follows:

 1. Clone the project onto your local machine.
 2. Create a feature branch, branch away from `master`
 3. Implement your features or additions.
 4. Test them and make sure, that your additions work.
 5. Be sure to comment on and document the important parts of your code.
 6. Push your branch and the changes to the repository.
 7. Create a merge request and describe the changes you implemented.
